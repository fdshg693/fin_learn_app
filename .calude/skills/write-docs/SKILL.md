Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help an AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase. Consider aspects like:

- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
- Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection alone
- Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
- Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

- Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
- Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
- Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
- Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
- Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns
